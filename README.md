## Introduction

**HealZone-2.0** is a user-friendly desktop application built to simplify the process of booking doctor appointments. No more standing in long lines or wondering if your doctor is available! With HealZone, patients can check doctor schedules, book appointments online, and arrive at the hospital at the right time â€” all from the comfort of their homes.

### Why HealZone?
Visiting a hospital to book an appointment is often frustrating. You wait in queues, check doctor availability, and sometimes leave without an appointment. HealZone solves this by bringing the entire process online, saving time and effort for both patients and doctors.

### Technologies Used
Hereâ€™s the tech stack I used to build HealZone:
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **UI Framework**: JavaFX
- **Styles**: CSS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (with SQLite support)
- **Build Tool**: Maven
- **Libraries**: JavaFX, PostgreSQL JDBC, SQLite JDBC
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA
- **Operating System**: Windows/Linux

### Who Is This For?
- **Patients**: Book appointments, view doctor schedules, and access prescriptions.
- **Doctors**: Manage availability, write prescriptions, and view appointment history.
- **Developers**: Understand the code and extend the system.

### Project Goals
HealZone aims to:
- Provide a fast and easy way to book doctor appointments online.
- Show real-time doctor availability to patients.
- Ensure a secure and user-friendly experience for everyone.

## Problem Statement

Booking a doctorâ€™s appointment in person is a time-consuming and frustrating process. Patients often have to:
- Wait in long lines at the hospital.
- Check if their preferred doctor is available.
- Deal with scheduling conflicts or unavailability.

This manual process wastes time, causes frustration, and disrupts both patientsâ€™ and doctorsâ€™ schedules. **HealZone-2.0** solves this by providing an online platform where patients can book appointments in just a few clicks, check real-time doctor availability, and plan their visits without hassle.

- To create a seamless online appointment booking system.
- To allow doctors to manage their schedules efficiently.
- To provide a secure login system with OTP verification.
- To enable patients to view and download prescriptions.
- To ensure the application is easy to use and responsive.
